AppDB Todo:

    * Improve application/version submission process
       Currently a user submits an application/version and a admin reviews it and 
either makes changes to it and accepts it or writes a comment and rejects it. Upon 
rejection the submission is deleted

       It would be more useful if instead of deleting the submission the submission 
was instead passed BACK to the person who submitted it so they could ammend it and 
resubmit it.

    * Add support for spell checking application, version submissions, description text 
and forum postings.

    * Allow admins to view both the application submission AND the version submission. In 
maybe 50% of the applications I accept I find out that the version submission was the 
default template with no testing information and/or was formatted in a difficult to 
understand way that required rejection. Seeing the application and the version at 
application processing time would let the admin decide at that time whether to accept or 
reject based on both the application and version.(Chris M - in progress)

    * Allow maintainers to handle screenshot and version submissions for the applications 
they maintain. The maintainer system has been a great success so far with over 150 
applications maintained by users of the appdb. These maintainers reply to forum postings 
for particular apps, edit and update application howto's and descriptions, and can add 
screenshots without appdb maintainer interaction. Having application maintainers also 
process screenshot and new version submissions would take more load off of the highest 
level maintainers of the appdb who have to go through all screenshots and all new 
versions that have been submitted.

Continuing this distribution of work to individual experts should let us provide more 
accurate and complete information.

    * Overhaul the look and feel of the appdb. It looks a bit clunky in areas and I think 
with some polish it would be more pleasing to the eye and easier to maintain the look and 
feel.

    * Bugzilla/Appdb bug integration
            - Links between bugs and the appdb app
            - Scott, can you fill in more here?
    * Bugzilla/Appdb login integration, Single signon for bugzilla and appdb.
            - Need to figure out how to combine the two sets of account databases
            - How to provide the bugzilla and appdb authentication cookies
            - How to make the changes to both appdb and bugzilla as localized as possible
                 to keep both applications usable for non-Wine related databases
    * Way to feedback information to the owner of the application to tell them that you use the app under wine
        - Might be as simple as adding a note to the application with the appropriate vendor email address.


# support for merging applications together.  We frequently have duplicate applications that need merging and its difficult to by hand

# support for merging versions together

# incorporate templates into appdb to simplify code, Jeremy says we can borrow from lostwages(winehq.org/cvsweb/lostwages) for this

# add a system that will allow users to monitor an app without becoming a maintainer.

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the user_list table.

# add wineversion, distro, source/package fields to the appComments table.

# add new table for maintainer ratings. fields: userid, appId versionId ,rating, wineversion, distro, source/package
