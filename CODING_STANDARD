WineHQ Application Database Coding Practice

########
# HTML #
########
- Respect html coding standards. The current doctype is HTML 4.01 transitional (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/)
Try to make your content validate nicely (http://validator.w3.org/)

- Think about upward compatibility. Some day we might choose another doctype like XHTML 1.0
(i.e. <br /> instead of <br>, avoid using styles tag and properties (bgcolor, borders & Co) and use stylesheets instead)


#######
# PHP #

- functions are written this way (that way {}'s are lined up):
<?
function foo() 
{
    if(isset($var))
    {
        echo "bar";
    }    
}
?>

- indentation is made of 4 spaces (no tabs please)

- line length should be no more than 130 characters, preferably < 80

- comments: Muli line code should look like this.

/**
 * This functions does nothing interesing.
 * More comments to come here...
 */
function bar()
{
    foo();
}

/**
 * If you want to highlight some thing this is permissable. for a single line
 */

if(!isset($appId))
{
    /* a single comment should be like this */
} else
{

    /* Shows a particular version. */
    if($versionId) 
    {
        /* Code comes here */
    }
    
    /* Shows an apps summary */
    else 
    {
       /* Another code comes here */
    }
}
