	<p><big><b>Welcome</b></big></p>
	
	<p>This is the Wine Application Database. From here you get info on application
	compatibility with Wine. For developers, you can get information on the APIs used in an
	application.</p>
	
	<p>Most of the features of the Application database require that you have a user account and
	are logged in. Some of the benefits of membership are:<p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Ability to Vote on Favorite Applications</li>
		<li>Access to the Application Rating System. Rate the apps that "Don't Suck"</li>
		<li>Ability to customize the View of the Apps DB and Comment System</li>
		<li>Take Credit for your witty posts.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>So what are you waiting for, [<a href="account.php?cmd=login">login now</a>]. Your help in
	stomping out Wine issues will be greatly appreciated.</p>
