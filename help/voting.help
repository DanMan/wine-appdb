<p><b> Voting System Notes </b></p>

<ul>

   <li><i>Please</i> seriously only vote for applications which will benefit the community. Don't
   vote for applications that are known to work well. We know Solitaire works. Voting for it
   would not make much sense.</li><p>

   <li>When voting for an application, you are voting for <b>ALL</b> its various versions. There is
   a separate system in place for ranking versions.</li><p>
   
   <li>You can clear your vote at anytime. Simply browse to any App in the database, select the app
   in your vote list you want to clear, and click the Clear button.</li><p>

</ul>
