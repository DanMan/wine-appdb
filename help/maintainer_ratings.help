<h3>Maintainers Ratings Definitions</h3>

<p>
The Application Database features a Maintainers rating system that allows you to see
which applications work the best in Wine. This rating system is designed to assist
users by giving a rating based on an "expert's" experience.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Gold</li>

<p>
An application can be rated as Gold if it installs and runs "out of the box".
</p>

<li>Silver</li>

<p>
If an application needs DLL overrides (native DLL's from a Windows installation) to install and
run but runs flawlessly otherwise, then it can be rated as silver. There should be an accompanying "How-To" 
written to allow users to get this application to run.
</p>

<li>Bronze</li>

<p>
Bronze Applications may have bugs in them and require DLL overrides. If the program can be used
as it was intended but is missing features then the can be rated as Bronze.
</p>

<li>Garbage</li>

<p>
An app gets this rating if it can not be used for the purpose it was designed.
There should be at least one bug report in bugzilla if an app gets this rating.
</p>

</ul>
