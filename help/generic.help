<!--TITLE: Additional Wine Help -->

This is meant as generic instructions in case an AppDB entry
for a certain program doesn't exist.

<ol>

<li> Make sure your Wine release is recent.</li><p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download"> Official WineHQ builds</a>
          for Linux Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Slackware and FreeBSD, hosted by 
       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6241">SourceForge.net</a>.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/cvs">Official WineHQ Source</a> for information on how to
          build and install Wine via source read over the 
       <a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/howto"> Wine HowTo</a>.</li>
       </ul>
	<p>

<li> You can run winecheck this handy tool is located in the /tools directory.
(chmod +x winecheck; ./winecheck)
to verify the most important aspects of Wine environment configuration.</li><p>

<li> Run your program</li><p>

<li> In case of failure, try different builtin, native DLL settings:
Run Wine with --debugmsg +loaddll to find out which
DLLs are loaded as native or builtin.
Then make sure appropriate native versions are in the
c:\windows\system directory as configured in your Wine
config file. There are five options you can choose from when setting
dll overrides, I will use commctrl here as an example.</li><p>

<pre>
"commctrl" = "native, builtin"
"commctrl" = "builtin, native "
"commctrl" = "native"
"commctrl" = "builtin"
"commctrl" = ""
</pre>


<li> In case of persisting failure, you may want to read over the
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/documentation">Wine Documentation</a>
