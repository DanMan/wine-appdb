This is meant as generic instructions in case an AppDB entry
for a certain program doesn't exist.

<li> Make sure your Wine release is recent.</li><p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download"> Official WineHQ builds</a>
          for Linux Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Slackware and FreeBSD, hosted by 
       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6241">SourceForge.net</a>.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/cvs">Official WineHQ Source</a> for information on how to
          build and install Wine via source read over the 
       <a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/howto"> Wine HowTo</a>.</li>
       </ul>
	<p>

<li> Run your program</li><p>

<li> If it gives an error about missing files, or does not start at all, try running it from the directory where it was installed.</li><p>

<li> Many newer games contain copy protection, which is often not supported in Wine.  Cracks are available from sites such as <a href="http://www.megagames.com/trainers.html" target="_blank">MegaGames</a>.</li><p>

<li> In case of failure, try different builtin, native DLL settings:
Run Wine with --debugmsg +loaddll to find out which
DLLs are loaded as native or builtin.
Then make sure appropriate native versions are in the
c:\windows\system32 directory as configured in Winecfg&#8217;s DLL overrides tab. There are four options you can choose from when setting
dll overrides.</li><p>
